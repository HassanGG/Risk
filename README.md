# Risk
This repository contains a version of the boardgame Risk I developed along with @DenzelVvs and @EFBm. The game is written in java using the library JavaFx.

### How to play
- Click the jar file in the Risk folder.
- Enter input on bottom left text field.  
- Output messages show on bottom right panel.  
- You don't have to enter the name of countries with spacing or capitals.
- Just type skip, to skip a phase.
